This repository documents a self-directed Kaggle project exploring the OTTO Recommender System dataset.

## âœ… Completed Days

### Day 1 â€“ Data Loading
- Loaded and explored OTTO's raw Parquet dataset.
- Mapped numeric event types to human-readable labels.

### Day 2 â€“ Behavior Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of clicks, carts, and orders.
- Visualized behavior counts and session length distributions.

### Day 3 â€“ Conversion Funnel
- Built a pivot table to summarize session-level behavior.
- Created boolean flags and visualized the user behavior funnel.

### Day 4 â€“ Sequential Pattern Mining
- Constructed user action sequences ordered by timestamp.
- Extracted frequent behavior paths and plotted common sequences.
