# OTTO Recommender System â€“ Days 1 to 21

This repository documents a self-directed Kaggle project exploring the OTTO Recommender System dataset.

## ðŸ›’ OTTO Recommender System (Kaggle Project)

This repository documents my learning journey through the OTTO RecSys Kaggle competition.  
The project is structured in daily progress notebooks, each extracting and engineering features from clickstream data.

âœ… Purpose: Strengthen my data science foundations  


Notebook highlights:
- Data loading & EDA
- Behavior statistics & funnels
- Sequential pattern mining
- Item-level popularity features

## âœ… Completed Days

### Day 1 â€“ Data Loading
- Loaded and explored OTTO's raw Parquet dataset.
- Mapped numeric event types to human-readable labels.

### Day 2 â€“ Behavior Analysis
- Analyzed the distribution of clicks, carts, and orders.
- Visualized behavior counts and session length distributions.

### Day 3 â€“ Conversion Funnel
- Built a pivot table to summarize session-level behavior.
- Created boolean flags and visualized the user behavior funnel.

### Day 4 â€“ Sequential Pattern Mining
- Constructed user action sequences ordered by timestamp.
- Extracted frequent behavior paths and plotted common sequences.

### Day 5 â€“ Item-Level Popularity Features
- Calculated total clicks, carts, and orders for each item.
- Created click-to-cart rate (CTR) and click-to-order rate (CVR).
- Visualized top 20 most clicked items.
- Saved all item-level stats for future model use.

### Day 6 â€“ Session-Level User Features
- Calculated the number of clicks, carts, and orders per session.
- Computed click ratio and session length for each user.
- Extracted active time period features (min, max, avg hour).
- Saved all session-level features for future training steps.
